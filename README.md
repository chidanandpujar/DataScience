#Machine Learning as an equation:
  A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T 
  and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
  Experience E is the information the machine processes using the taks T, 
  to get to closer to what you want to produce, the performance measure P.

  How humans learns, by analysing the data, finding the patterns and use 
  the patterns to make decisions or to predict the outcome of future events.
  What happens when we have too much data ?
