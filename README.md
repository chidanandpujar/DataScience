Machine Learning as an equation:

  A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T 
  and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
  Experience E is the information the machine processes using the taks T, 
  to get to closer to what you want to produce, the performance measure P.

  How humans learns, by analysing the data, finding the patterns and use 
  the patterns to make decisions or to predict the outcome of future events.
  What happens when we have too much data ?
  Whether humans have the ability to analyse and find the patterns from volume of data.
  Why do we need ML? 
    It is all about the volume of the data available to us,
    ML will learn from the data we give them and, importantly, respond to changes in the data they are given to produce useful results.

Real World applications of machine learning:

Machine learning involves the use of computer algorithms to learn how to perform different tasks.
Let’s look at a few examples where machine learning is being applied.

  1) Robotics:

      Some examples of machine learning applications in robotics are creating walking and jumping patterns for humanoid robots

  5)  Board Games:
     
      In March 2016; AlphaGo, the board-game-playing AI from Google’s DeepMind beat Korean Go Champion Lee Sedol 4-1. 
      AlphaGo uses deep neural networks and Monte Carlo tree search.

      Watch this 3 minute trailer for the AlphaGo documentary. 
      The win is a defining moment in AI similar to when the computer, Deep Blue, beat Garry Kasparov at chess in 1996.

  6)  Voice Recognition:
      Technologies such as Siri and Google Home are examples of this. Siri uses speech recognizer, 
      natural language processing and text-to-speech techniques.
      The Australian Government Tax Office now holds millions of voice prints to identify Australians.
      Their voice is compared with a stored voiceprint which captures more than 140 unique physical and 
      behavioural characteristics of a person such as length of the vocal tract and nasal passage, 
      the size and shape of the larynx, pitch, cadence and accent. (Nott, 2016)
      
      How would you go at recognising people by voice? How about a million people? This is where machine learning excels.

  7)  Digit Recognition:
      Digit Recognition is the task of reading in the images of handwritten numbers and letters and 
      outputting its machine-encoded equivalent. Machine Learning methods (SVM and Deep Learning) have hit >99% accuracy for this task.
      Other examples are detection of numberplates, printed numbers on bills, handwriting and CAPTCHA.

  8)  Other interesting applications
      A wide variety of machine learning applications are related to:

      healthcare analytics
      stock market prediction
      business analytics
      facial recognition

Machine Learning steps:

  Step 1: Data Manipulation
  
    This is a process of data preparation. ML usually uses the largest sets of data available.
    The first step in data manipulation is Data Acquisition. 

    Data acquisition is the process of sampling information that illustrates real world physical conditions with a predefined measurement. 
    Using our car example, you might measure engine size, number of doors, size of tyres etc.

    The data acquired should be reliable for converting into digital numeric values that can be manipulated by a computer. 
    Number of car doors is easy; style is less easy to define numerically.

    Once the data is properly stored, any redundant, noisy, unusable parts of it should be trimmed. 
    We call this procedure Data Cleaning. Data cleaning is a major step as real-world datasets are highly affected by noise, 
    redundancy and missing values. We might delete any three-wheeled cars because they’re so unusual.

  Step 2: Analytics
  
    The second main step in machine learning is Analytics. Analytics mainly involves finding relationships and 
    correlations in the prepared data in order to design an accurate model based on that input data.

    In addition, Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach for analysing datasets in order to summarise their main characteristics or features. 
    Many exploratory data analysis methods use visual illustration of data, based on different features. Things like graphs, charts and 
    tables make data easier to understand.

    Finally Predictive Machine Learning is the last stage of Analytics. 
    It uses a variety of statistical techniques such as predictive modelling in order to build a classifier or 
    intelligent system for decision making.
  
  Step 3: Evaluation and Visualisation
  
    The final result of Analytics is an intelligent system or model. As the last step of ML design, we have to evaluate the performance of the system. 
    “Did I choose the right car?”

    If the quality and performance of the intelligent system does not achieve a satisfactory outcome, 
    the Refinement procedure is required and another round of data manipulation and analytics becomes necessary.
