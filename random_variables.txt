Random variables is a function that can assign probabilties of events of interest in a random experiment
P(head) = 0.6
P(tail) = 0.4
P(X=1) = 0.6
P(X=0) = 0.4

Two types of random variables

Discrete random variables have a countable number of values. For example, faces of dice, number of emails received in an hour
Discrete random variables are defined using a Probability Mass Functions(PMF)  P(X = x)

To find the probability of rolling a dice and getting a number less than 5 ? 
In this case we have to use Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). The cumulative distribution function gives us the cumulative probability associated
with function F(X) = P(X <= x) = Sum of values of xi < x  P(X = xi)

Rolling dice example
Probability of getting 1 is 1/6
Prabability of gettting 2 is 2/6
Proability of getting 3 is 3/6
Probability of getting 4 is 4/6
Probabilty of getting 5 is 5/6
Probability of getting 6 is 6/6

Then the Probability of seeing a number equal or less than five is P(X <= 5) = 5/6

We can say the probability of seeing a number greater than five is P(X > 5) = 1 - ( 5/6 ) = 1/6


Continuous random variables can take values in a infinite continuum. For example, hieght of a person, time to failure etc
Continuous random variables are defined using Probability Density Function (PDF), denoted f(x) , it defines a probability distribution for a continuous random variable

f(x) d(x) = P( x <= x <= x + dx) integrating to 1
